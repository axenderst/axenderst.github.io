        <h1>What's the project about</h1>
        <p> The Project Propensity to Purchase in Procurement with data provided by Inprova (Department of Computer Science 2017) is conducted as an MSc dissertation project 
		from the module COMP702 (Martin 2017), and it will be developed by the student Victor Ortiz, who is to be supervised by Dr. David Hamilton as Primary supervisor and 
		Dr. Leszek Gasieniec as Secondary supervisor, and it emerges as part of the collaboration between the University of Liverpool and Inprova Group. </br></br>
		The main objective of 
		this project is to create a Propensity to Purchase Model (Miller 2012) based on data provided by Inprova Group (from their customer's database) and also data obtained 
		from the Housing Net website (HousingNet.co.uk 2017). The model predicts the propensity to buy of a specific potential client, this allows to identify potential customers
		and at the same time identify those features or attributes that make them different from each other, to be able to approach each customer in a more personalized way. </br></br>
		To achieve this goal, we use Predictive Analytics (Kotu and Deshpande 2015), which is a set of techniques that can take some available historical data and predict with
		certain accuracy the future behavior of an analyzed agent. </br></br> Our proposed solution is constituted by two phases, first we create a classifier for the resulting data set 
		from the merging of the Inprova dataset and the HousingNet dataset, that will distinguish between “Buyers” and “Not buyers” and as a second phase we implement some 
		Clustering algorithm to be able to identify those groups that share some certain degree of similarity (Raschka 2015).</br></br> For the classifier, we will use data provided by 
		Inprova from their actual client’s database and based on that information we will generate a “positive” part of the training/testing dataset, we are considering all 
		the clients contained in the Inprova’s data set as Positive because they are current or past customers. The second step is to merge the datasets (Inprova’s & HousingNet),
		and we are doing that by calculating the Levenshtein Distance (Gilleland s.f.) and from the result, we merge the datasets. The negative part of the dataset is composed of
		those records from the HousingNet dataset that were not matched with any of the Inprova’s current clients. With that information, we generate a Target Variable which takes 
		Boolean values, 1 for those who are clients, and 0 for those who are not. </br></br>During this project, we aimed to identify which of the analyzed classification algorithms is 
		the one that is the most suitable for the available data, because each classifier has its own strengths and requirements depending on the data available during the 
		learning stage. The Classifying algorithms that are analyzed for the classifier are: </br>1. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) </br>2. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) </br>3. Logistic regression </br>4. 
		Support Vector Machines (SVM) </br></br>For the second section of the solution, we executed a Clustering Analysis based on the resulting dataset of those registers classified as 
		“Buyers”, which is helping us to find any hidden structure in the data of our potential clients and based in this we can separate them in groups that have a certain 
		similarity. The algorithms that are included in this model to assess their suitability are the following: </br>1. The K-means algorithm </br>2. Hierarchical Clustering </p>
