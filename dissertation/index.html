        <h1>Abstract of the project</h1>
        <p>    The project named: <b>Propensity to Purchase in Procurement</b> with data provided by Inprova, has a main objective to develop a model 
		which will help to classify those potential clients that are more likely to engage in a transaction with Inprova Group, and at 
		the same time to identify those features that make the clients different between them, in order to be able to approach them in different ways. 
		</br></br>  The model is developed using Predictive Analytics, specifically Classification and Clustering algorithms.
		</br></br>  Our solution is composed of a model that performs a two-step analysis, the first will implement a classification 
		algorithm that will differentiate form a list of commercial entities those whom are potentially customers of those who are not. 
		In the second phase of the analysis, a clustering algorithm is implemented and it will allow us to identify those hidden 
		patterns among the potential customers.
